# Study of stellar populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud using data from the Gaia mission
## Summary
Star formation (SF) is one of the fundamental processes for understanding the distribution of stellar populations and the evolution of galaxies over time. This thesis aims to analyse the stellar populations within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using photometric and astrometric data from the third data release of the European Space Agency (ESA) Gaia mission (EDR3). <br>
Both Magellanic Clouds, particularly the SMC, offer an environment that is still highly SF, thanks mainly to the presence of low-metallicity environments. To proceed with the study, a stellar catalogue centred on the SMC was initially extracted using ADQL on the Gaia Archive. Subsequently, the data obtained were processed using TOPCAT software, which allowed the creation of colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The CMDs were analysed and compared with theoretical low-metallicity isochrones obtained from the BaSti database and reported in the Gaia filters. Based on this comparison, the age of the stellar populations present in the SMC was finally studied in order to observe the distributions of the areas where younger and older stars are present.

## Introduction
The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a satellite of the Milky Way (MW). It can be considered an ideal laboratory for studying the stellar populations of a galaxy that, over time, has been characterised by vigorous star formation (SF) in different periods. Furthermore, since the SMC is in gravitational interaction with two different systems, namely the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW, it is an object of great interest for the study of the physical conditions that regulate SF in environments outside our Galaxy. <br>
In both Magellanic galaxies, the stellar populations show a wide range of ages. The first stars were generated simultaneously with the initial increase in SF in the other galaxies of the Local Group, while the most recent ones date back only a few Myr, highlighting the intensity of SF that is still ongoing. <br>
The thesis work is based on the use of astrometric and photometric data provided by the third data release of the European Space Agency (ESA) Gaia mission (EDR3), whose objective is to study the stellar populations of the MW and the Local Group. <br>
These Gaia data were used because they make it possible to resolve the stars under investigation. In fact, due to the distance along the line of sight, stars belonging to the SMC and the MW frequently overlap, making it difficult to isolate only the stars actually present in the SMC. This problem can be overcome by selecting only the stars of interest kinematically using information on their proper motions. In conclusion, large, high-precision catalogues are needed to enable an accurate census of stellar populations, thus excluding any contamination from external stars. The chapters will explore the theoretical foundations underlying the work and the analysis carried out on the data, leading to a discussion of the final results and future prospects. Specifically, the work is structured as follows: <br>
    i. Theoretical foundations that form the basis of this thesis. <br>
    ii. In-depth analysis of the tools used. <br>
    iii. Data collection, analysis and processing activities. <br>
    iv. Presentation of the results and conclusions reached. <br>
